# Beams
Software used to automate creation of nesting files for various kinds of beams using DraftSights API.

For the software to work DraftSigt has to be running. By default we are adding 15mm to each with a cut width of 410mm for material width of 405mm.

Software also supports adding beam dimensions by dragging over a csv file. 

Sample structure of CSV shown below, real CSV would not have headers.
| BeamNo         | BeamLength in mm |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 5648      |
| 3      |  6316 |
| 5      |  6543 |
| 7      |  8872 |
